This script is a powerful DDOS (distributed denial of service) script written in Python. It takes in parameters from the command line such as the IP address of the target, the port to attack, the size of the packets to send, and the duration of the attack. It then creates a socket, generates random bytes for the data of the packets, and begins sending the packets to the target in an attempt to overwhelm the system and cause it to shut down.

To use this script, type the following command into your terminal:
python3 ddos.py <ip> <port> <packet size> <time>

Replace <ip> with the target IP address, <port> with the target port, <packet size> with the size of the packets to send, and <time> with the length of time you want to attack the target.
